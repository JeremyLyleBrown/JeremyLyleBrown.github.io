# Metis Week 1: The Bootcamp Learning Process

Metis week 1 is now complete! It's been a flurry of activity, and I'll use this post as a means of reflecting on my first week experience.

So far, some of my most valuable learning experiences happened when I hit a wall when working on solving a problem. The process of "building the ladder" over problems I've encountered is an amazing teacher, one that the bootcamp model encourages - AKA learning by doing.

There's one particular wall (of many) that is memorable to me from the first Metis project. My task was to analyze income tax statistics data from the IRS by ZIP code, and export a table of relative wealth level by ZIP code for to be used for a visualization on a map of NYC. Working with data from every ZIP code in the United States, I needed a way to eliminate unecessary datapoints (data from ZIP codes outside of NYC) so that I could pass only the relevant bits to my team's visualization script. After a simple Google search I found a table containing every ZIP code by burough.

I was then presented with a choice: do I copy/paste these ~180 ZIP codes into my python script (a total of ~12 clicks with some minor formatting), or should I obtain these numbers programmatically?

Even though web scraping, something I'd never done before, was being covered the next week, I decided to approach this problem programmatically and try it then and there. I began another Google search to figure out how to obtain this data off this webpage. It took me more than an hour to figure out how to scrape this data, and more time on top of that to shape it into the list I needed to iterate through.

In this case, I was presented with an opportunity to either save time or learn something new. Looking back, I'd prefer to use my time more efficiently by copy/pasting the zip codes into the format I needed, something that wouldn't have taken more than 3 minutes. But if I had done that, then I wouldn't have been exposed to web scraping ahead of time. Even so, this particular wall was flimsy - I could have flicked it and it would have fallen over. On the spectrum of learning vs. practicality, I sided with spending time learning, when I likely should have chosen the most efficient way to do this task, and therefore could use the additional time learning something else.

Why am I caught up in thinking about time vs. practicality? Because as a bootcamp student, my time has suddenly become very valuable - there is always something to work on, read, or try out. Moving forward, I'll have to prioritize with more care. I don't regret spending that time learning something new, but I could have used that time towards further polishing the project instead of focusing on an area where practically the solution was simple.

When a problem is viewed as an opportunity - a wall with a ladder - it can help make that problem more approachable and less intimidating. But it's still important to examine whether the problem is all that worthy of building a ladder over.
